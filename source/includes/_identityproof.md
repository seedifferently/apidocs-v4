PokitDok's Identity Proof API allows providers to validate and verify patient provided information against identity
records maintained by government agencies, credit bureaus, and insurance companies.

Validation is the process of determining whether an identity matching the request is present in our system. By
validating patient information, providers can prevent erroneous records from being created due to data entry mistakes.

Verification is the process of determining whether the given identity belongs to the customer who made the request;
ensuring that the patient is who they say they are. To accomplish this, our Identity Proof API produces security
questions for the patient to answer in order to prove their authenticity in a process called KBA (Knowledge Based
Authentication). When used during account creation, or password recovery, KBA ensures that patients' privacy is
protected while still allowing them convenient access to their own healthcare information.

##### Identity Proof

| Endpoint                            | HTTP Method | Description                                             |

| /identity/proof/valid/              | POST        | Validate's the identity fields provided by the patient. |

The /identity/proof/questions/generate/ and /identity/proof/valid/ endpoints both accept the same Identity Proof
Request (IPR) json document defined below.

| Parameter                 | Type     | Description                                                                       | Required |

| address.city              | {string} | The city/town of the patient's street address.                                    | Yes      |

| ip_address                | {string} | The ip address the patient is using to connect to the provider system.            | No       |

It is worth noting that validation will always be run as part of verification, so providers do not need to hit the
/identity/proof/valid/ endpoint prior to a /identity/proof/questions/generate/ call.

### Responses

> VALID response data:

```
{
	"is_verifiable": false,
	"is_valid": true
}
```
> INVALID response data:

```
{
	"is_verifiable": false,
	"is_valid": false
}
```

> OK response data:

```
{
	"is_verifiable": true,
	"is_valid": true,
	"question": {"answers": [{"answer": "49557", "id": 1},
                             {"answer": "49511", "id": 2},
                             {"answer": "49728", "id": 3},
                             {"answer": "49230", "id": 4},
                             {"answer": "None Of The Above", "id": 5}],
                "id": 1,
                "text": "Which one of the following zip codes is associated with you?"}
}
```

The /identity/proof/questions/generate/ endpoint can return several types of responses. Only a VERIFIABLE response will include the first
question of a KBA questionnaire; allowing the patient to begin the KBA process. To protect the integrity of the KBA
process, KBA questionnaires expire after 25 minutes. Additionally, identities will be locked for 12 hours following
the creation of a KBA questionnaire in order to guard against brute force attacks.

| Type | Code | Reason |
| :--- | :---: | --- |
| BAD REQUEST | 400 | Required fields were missing or invalid.
| FORBIDDEN | 403 | The requested Identity has been temporarily locked following successful questionnaire generation, or following the detection of suspicious activity.
| INVALID | 200 | The request was valid, but an identity matching the request could not be found.
| VALID | 200 | The request was valid, and a matching identity was found, but there was insufficient data with which to generate questions.
| VERIFIABLE | 200 | questionnaire was successfully generated.



### Scoring
The `/identity/proof/questions/score` endpoint handles the scoring of the questionnaires generated by the
`/identity/proof/questions/generate` endpoint. Requests submitted to `/identity/proof/questions/score` should have
the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Type     | Description                                    |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| questionnaire_id | {string} | The KBA Questionnaire's uuid.                  |
| question_id      | {string} | The question id.                               |
| answer           | {string} | The answer_id of the choice the user selected. |

Provided the request parameters were valid, the `/identity/proof/questions/score` endpoint will produce one of three
types of response.

> Example: Submitting a user response.

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
 -XPOST -d '{
        "questionnaire_id": "a9ec1381-5ad6-499b-a3a6-644ece186363",
        "question_id": 1,
        "answer": 2
    }' https://platform.pokitdok.com/api/v4/identity/proof/questions/score/
```

```python
client.request('/identity/proof/questions/score/', method='post', data={
        "questionnaire_id": "a9ec1381-5ad6-499b-a3a6-644ece186363",
        "question_id": 1,
        "answer": 2
    })
```

```csharp
string endpoint = "/identity/proof/questions/score/";
string method = "POST";
Dictionary<string, object> data = new Dictionary<string, object> {
       {"questionnaire_id", new string[] { "a9ec1381-5ad6-499b-a3a6-644ece186363" },
       {"question_id", new int[] { 1 },
       {"answer", new int[] { 2 }
    };
client.request(endpoint, method, data);
```

```ruby
client.request('/identity/proof/questions/score/', method='post', params={
       questionnaire_id: "a9ec1381-5ad6-499b-a3a6-644ece186363",
       question_id: 1,
       answer: 2
    })
```

```java
```

#### Failure

> Failure

```
{
	"status": "FAILURE",
	"next_attempt": "2016-10-14T21:06:43.292695",
	"customer_notified": false
}
```

In this case the customer has answered enough questions inaccurately that we're confident that the user is
interacting with an imposter, and not the customer. To protect the customer's identity we refuse to generate
questions for that identity for 12 hours. To reflect this we include the `next_attempt` parameter; the datetime after
which the identity in question will again be serviced by the API. Finally, we include a boolean value,
`customer_notified` reflecting whether or not the customer has been notified of this KBA attempt.

#### Success

> Success

```
{
	"status": "SUCCESS",
	"customer_notified": false
}
```

In this case the customer has answered enough questions correctly that we're confident that they are who they say
they are.

#### PENDING

> Pending

```
{
	"status": "PENDING",
	"question": {"answers": [{"answer": "49557", "id": 1},
                             {"answer": "49511", "id": 2},
                             {"answer": "49728", "id": 3},
                             {"answer": "49230", "id": 4},
                             {"answer": "None Of The Above", "id": 5}],
                "id": 2,
                "text": "Which one of the following zip codes is associated with you?"}
}
```

In this case the scoring of the question did not grant us enough information to pass or fail the customer. Instead,
we return the next question associated with that questionnaire.
